<h1>
  Hill Encryption Project
</h1>

For the program, run **encrypt.java** which is located in the "src" folder.

This is a Java programming project I worked on this semester with my Calculus II professor that uses concepts from linear algebra (matrices and determinants) and modular arithmetic to encrypt user-inputted messages using a variant of the Hill Encryption algorithm. 

Read the file named **Hill Encryption.pdf** to understand the encryption algorithm used in the program.

While I was able to successfully encrypt the user-inputted message, decrypting it requires a solid grasp of modular arithmetic, which I currently lack. This part of the project thus remains a work in progress. Next semester, I will be taking a relevant course (Discrete Math) in college that will provide me with the necessary knowledge to bridge this gap, after which I will finalize the decryption algorithm and truly finish the project.
