<h1>
  Hill Encryption Project
</h1>

For the program, run **encrypt.java** which is located in the "src" folder.

A Java programming project I worked on this semester with my Calculus II professor that uses concepts from linear algebra (matrices and determinants), modular arithmetic, to encrypt user-inputted messages using a variant of the Hill Encryption algorithm. Read the file named **Hill Encryption.pdf** to dive deeper into the mathematical aspect of how this algorithm works. 

I was able to successfully encrypt the user-inputted message, but decrypting it requires a solid grasp of modular arithmetic, which I currently lack. This part of the project remains a work in progress. Next semester, I will take MAT243: Discrete Mathematical Structures, a course that will provide me with the necessary knowledge to bridge this gap. Upon completing the coursework, I plan to finalize the decryption algorithm, which will bring the project to completion.
