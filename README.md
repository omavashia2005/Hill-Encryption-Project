<h1>
  Hill Encryption Project
</h1>

For the program, run **encrypt.java** which is located in the "src" folder.

This is a Java programming project I worked on spring semester of freshman year with my Calculus II professor that uses concepts from linear algebra (matrices and determinants) and modular arithmetic to encrypt user-inputted messages using a variant of the Hill Encryption algorithm. 

Read the file named **Hill Encryption.pdf** to understand the encryption algorithm used in the program.
