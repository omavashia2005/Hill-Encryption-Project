<h1>
  Hill Encryption Project
</h1>

A Java programming project I worked on this semester with my Calculus II professor that uses concepts from linear algebra (matrices and determinants), modular arithmetic, to encrypt user-inputted messages using a variant of the Hill Encryption algorithm. Read the file named **Hill Encryption.pdf** to dive deeper into the mathematical aspect of how this algorithm works. To read the program itself, you can read/go through **encrypt.java**.
